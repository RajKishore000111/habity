# Habity - Personalized 60-Day Self-Improvement Plan

Habity is a web application that generates a personalized 60-day self-improvement plan based on a user’s responses to a multi-step questionnaire. The plan is adaptive based on the user's exercise preferences, commitment level, and lifestyle factors. Users can later log in to track their daily progress and update their digital journal.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Questionnaire:**  
  Collects personal information, physical activity details, exercise preferences, sleep and meditation habits, and life goals.

- **Personalized 60-Day Plan:**  
  Generates a dynamic plan with adaptive tasks based on the user's responses.

- **Daily View:**  
  Each day’s plan appears on its own page with navigation buttons. The plan automatically advances daily (based on Pacific Time) when the user logs in.

- **Dynamic Background:**  
  A full-screen, animated background slideshow enhances the visual appeal.

- **Future Integrations:**  
  Planned integration with Paddle for payment processing and a signup/login system for secure access to the plan.
